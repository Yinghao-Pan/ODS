Description: Outcome-dependent sampling (ODS) schemes are cost-effective ways to
    enhance study efficiency. In ODS designs, one observes the exposure/covariates
    with a probability that depends on the outcome variable. Popular ODS designs
    include case-control for binary outcome, case-cohort for time-to-event outcome,
    and continuous outcome ODS design (Zhou et al. 2002). This package implements
    two statistical methods related to ODS designs: (1) An empirical likelihood method
    analyzing the primary continuous outcome with respect to exposure variables in
    continuous ODS design (Zhou et al., 2002). (2) A partial linear model
    analyzing the primary outcome in continuous ODS design (Zhou, Qin and Longnecker, 2011).
